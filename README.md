## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- A simple wireframe of the site, showing grids and breakpoints, is worth developing before you start the markup and base styles.
- Keep it simple where you can. Start getting the layout looking right using the most straightforward methods available, then mix in complexity when needed.
